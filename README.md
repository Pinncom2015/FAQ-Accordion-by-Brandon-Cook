### What I learned


In creating this FAQ, I've learned and used several key web development technologies and concepts:

HTML (HyperText Markup Language): I used HTML to structure My webpage, defining elements like divs, images, details and summaries. This language is used to create the skeleton of web pages.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): I used CSS to style my webpage, controlling laIts, colors, fonts, and more. I learned how to use flexbox for layout management, which is a powerful tool for aligning and distributing space among items in a container.

Responsive Design: Throughout this process, I practiced responsive design principles. I ensured that the laIt and images are responsive to different viewport sizes, making the site more accessible and user-friendly.

Positioning and Z-index: I learned how to stack elements on top of each other using the position: absolute; and position: relative; CSS properties, along with the z-index property to control the stacking order.

Custom HTML Elements: I worked with the <details> and <summary> HTML elements to create an accordion-style collapsible list, a common component in many web designs.

Web Accessibility: By using proper alt text for images, I've made Ir webpage more accessible to people using screen readers or who have images disabled.

External Resources: I've incorporated external resources into Ir project, including Google Fonts and images.

CSS Pseudo-Elements: I've also encountered pseudo-elements when customizing the default display of <summary> elements.

All these skills are fundamental to web development and design, and can be applied in a wide variety of projects going forward.


### Continued development

JavaScript: With JavaScript, I can manipulate HTML and CSS in real-time, handle user input, fetch data from APIs, and much more.

CSS Advanced Topics: Dive deeper into CSS to understand concepts such as CSS Grid, animations, and transitions. Also, learn about CSS preprocessors like Sass or Less which can help I write more maintainable and scalable styles.

Front-End Frameworks and Libraries: Consider learning a front-end framework or library such as React, Vue.js, or Angular. These tools can help I build complex, single-page applications more efficiently.

Back-End Development: To become a full-stack developer, I could start learning back-end technologies like Node.js, Express.js, and databases like SQL or MongoDB.

Version Control: Git is a version control system that helps I keep track of changes to Ir code, collaborate with others, and is widely used in the industry.

Web Accessibility: Dive deeper into accessibility best practices to ensure Ir websites can be used by all people, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.

Performance and Optimization: Learn about web performance and how to optimize Ir code for speed. This could include understanding critical rendering path, lazy loading, code splitting etc.

Testing: Learn how to write tests for Ir code. Testing ensures Ir code works as expected and makes it easier to add features or refactor Ir code.
